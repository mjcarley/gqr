Generation of radial and angular quadrature rules for integration of
singular functions on triangles, as in Bremer and Gimbutas, 2013,
http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2013.05.048

The functions in this directory use gqr-rule to generate quadrature
rules which integrate the functions which arise in boundary integral
problems, as described by Bremer and Gimbutas. The main scripts are
radial-rules and angular-rules, which generate rules for functions of
the form of equations 22 and 23 respectively of Bremer and Gimbutas.

The makefile will generate a full set of quadrature rules and
incorporate them into two C files, radial-rules.c and angular-rules.c
respectively. Each has a simple function which selects a precomputed
quadrature rule matching the required parameters. For example,

radial_quadrature_select(gint N, gdouble d, gdouble **q, gint *nq)

selects a rule of order N (a multiple of 4), with parameter d (Bremer
and Gimbutas's \delta). The rule is returned as a pointer q to an
array of length 2*nq, containing the nodes and weights with

  x_i = q[2*i+0], w_i = q[2*i+1], 0<= i < nq,

where x_i and w_i are the nodes and weights respectively.

The test program triangle-tests checks the rules against analytical
evaluation of the corresponding integrals.
