Brief notes on installation requirements

You need a working BLAS and LAPACK installed and visible to the linker.

For the generalized rules using the Bremer and Gimbutas algorithms,
you need to install ACM 782 which you can download here:

https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/290200.287638

When you have downloaded 782.gz, you will need to process it to
correct some errors in the shar archive as follows:

> cp 782.gz 782.sh

> sed -i '1,3d' 782.sh

> sed -i 's/\$[\(]/\\$\(/g' 782.sh
> sed -i 's/\$[\?]/\\$?/g' 782.sh

> sh 782.sh

This will unpack the archive and allow it to compile correctly. When
you have compiled it, move rrqr.a to librrqr.a in a place where your
compiler can see it, before configuring gqr.
